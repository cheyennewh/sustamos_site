## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Fit the logistic regression models
model1 <- glm(hits ~ Memorability_Score, data = mem_att, family = binomial)
model2 <- glm(hits ~ Memorability_Score * zv, data = mem_att, family = binomial)

# Create a new data frame for predictions
new_data <- expand.grid(
  Memorability_Score = seq(min(mem_att$Memorability_Score), max(mem_att$Memorability_Score), length.out = 100),
  zv = mem_att$zv
)
new_data$zv <- matrix(mem_att$zv, ncol = 1)
attr(new_data$zv, "scaled:center") <- attr(mem_att$zv, "scaled:center")
attr(new_data$zv, "scaled:scale") <- attr(mem_att$zv, "scaled:scale")
# Predict probabilities using both models
new_data$pred_model1 <- predict(model1, newdata = new_data, type = "response")
new_data$pred_model2 <- predict(model2, newdata = new_data, type = "response")

# Plot
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(df, aes(x = Memorability_Score, y = hits)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +  # Optional: to show original data points
  geom_line(data = new_data, aes(y = pred_model1, color = "Model 1 (memory ~ memorability)")) +
  geom_line(data = new_data, aes(y = pred_model2, color = "Model 2 (memory ~ memorability * valence)")) +
  facet_wrap(~valence) +  # Separate lines by valence if you want them on the same plot
  labs(
    title = "Predicted Memory vs. Memorability (Logistic Regression)",
    x = "Memorability",
    y = "Predicted Probability of Memory",
    color = "Model"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
